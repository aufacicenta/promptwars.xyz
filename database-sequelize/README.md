#### /ask Let's not edit files yet. So this game prompt wars has the following flow: users fund their credits balance via a blockchain transfer or card payment. Each credit costs 1 USD. A credit is valid for 1 game round. 1 game round starts every 5 minutes. A game round is a match against the clock to write the best prompt to render the source image on display. When the prompt is submitted before the time is over, it passes through an AI image GPT API to get the prompt-to-image result and this result is then compared to the source image using a pixelmatch library. This image comparison library usually returns a number between 0 and 1, where 1 is the most similar to the image.

Thank you for providing this overview of the Prompt Wars game flow. It's a fascinating concept that combines prompt
engineering, AI image generation, and competitive gameplay. Let's break down the key components of this game:

1. Credit System:

   - Users fund their credit balance via blockchain transfer or card payment.
   - Each credit costs 1 USD.
   - One credit is valid for one game round.

2. Game Rounds:

   - A new game round starts every 5 minutes.
   - Players compete against the clock to write the best prompt.

3. Gameplay:

   - A source image is displayed to the players.
   - Players write prompts to try and recreate the source image.
   - Prompts must be submitted before the time runs out.

4. Image Generation and Comparison:

   - Submitted prompts are processed through an AI image generation API.
   - The generated image is compared to the source image using a pixelmatch library.
   - The comparison yields a similarity score between 0 and 1, with 1 being the most similar.

5. Scoring:
   - Players are likely ranked based on their similarity scores.

This game structure encourages creativity, quick thinking, and an understanding of how to craft effective prompts for AI
image generation. It also introduces an element of strategy in managing credits and deciding which rounds to participate
in.

To implement this in a server-based architecture, you'll need to consider:

1. User authentication and credit management system
2. A scheduler for starting new game rounds every 5 minutes
3. A system for displaying the source image to all active players
4. A mechanism for accepting and validating prompt submissions within the time limit
5. Integration with an AI image generation API
6. Implementation of the image comparison algorithm
7. A scoring and ranking system for each round
8. Real-time updates to players about the game status and results

Would you like to focus on any specific part of this system for implementation or have any questions about how to
approach these components?
